# Dependencies 
The only dependency used is jest for testing
Use 'npm test' to run the testing

readline-sync was original added for testing during build out but has been removed from the code

# MVP
After hitting MVP I decided to add tests for a few more edge cases such as non standard data being passed into the function as well as adding a look up table so a menu could be easily changed.
